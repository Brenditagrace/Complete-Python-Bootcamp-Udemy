    "### pdb Module\n",
    "Debugging in Python is facilitated by pdb module(python debugger) which comes built-in to the Python standard library. It is actually defined as the class Pdb which internally makes use of bdb(basic debugger functions) and cmd(support for line-oriented command interpreters) modules. The major advantage of pdb is it runs purely in the command line thereby making it great for debugging code on remote servers when we donâ€™t have the privilege of a GUI-based debugger. \n",
